AgriData Explorer: Understanding Indian agriculture with EDA

This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provides a comprehensive overview of India's agricultural trends using a district-level dataset. 
The analysis identifies the top-performing states and districts for major crops, including rice, wheat, oilseeds, and groundnuts, through ranked bar charts. 
Time-series analysis over the last 50 years reveals long-term production trends for staples like sugarcane, rice, and wheat. 
Comparative visuals are used to contrast metrics, such as rice versus wheat yield across all states and seasonal sorghum production.

The relationship between cultivated area and production output for key cereals is explored using scatter plots. 
Efficiency is also a key theme, with combo charts illustrating the link between total production and yield for crops like soybeans. 
The EDA includes deep-dive analyses into specific regions, such as rice production in West Bengal's districts and the top production years for wheat in Uttar Pradesh. 
Finally, the project presents multi-faceted comparisons, like the production of wheat and rice in the top 5 states over a 10-year period using small multiples, offering a granular view of agricultural performance.

This analysis uses SQL to provide a multifaceted view of India's agricultural landscape. It identifies the top three rice-producing states and tracks their output trends on a year-by-year basis. 
The queries pinpoint the top five districts with the most significant increase in wheat yield over the last five years. 
A key focus is on growth, calculating and ranking states with the highest growth rate in oilseed production. 
It also examines the district-level correlation between cultivated area and production for major crops like rice, wheat, and maize.

The yearly production growth of cotton is analyzed specifically for the five leading states in that sector. 
The analysis also identifies top-performing districts for specific metrics, like the highest groundnut producers in 2020 and those with the best overall rice yield. 
State-level aggregations are performed to find the total area cultivated for oilseeds and the annual average maize yield. Finally, a detailed comparative analysis contrasts the rice and wheat production of the top five states over the last decade.
